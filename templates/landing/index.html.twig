                Thanks for showing an interest in Student Government! First off, please explore our many services and programs and utilize them during your time as a student. From Wildcab to Wildcat Wardrobe, our services address various aspects of the student experience, but they are sure to make life just a little bit easier.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, as your elected representatives, we strive to engage with students as much as possible in order to ensure the feedback we are providing to administrators is accurate and matches the pulse of campus. So, leave feedback here on our site, email us, call us, or best of all, visit us in our office space in Student Center Suite A267 in the Center for Student Involvement!
                Finally, get involved! We have a great team of passionate leaders, but we can always benefit from new perspectives. Run to be a senator or executive member in our general election in the spring, apply to be a director or coordinator, or just stay in touch and talk to us about what you are passionate or concerned about!
                <br><br>
